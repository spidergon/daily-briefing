# Daily Briefing

Get your daily briefing of motivation messages, daily hot news (localized by country) and your current weather.

## Overview

This site is comprised of static files generated by [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) for simplified deployment and hosting.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. To build the site you need:

   - [Node](https://nodejs.org) - to run the build
   - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - to install and manage dependencies

2. **Clone this repository.**

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:spidergon/daily-briefing.git
   ```

3. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into working directory and start it up.

   ```shell
   cd daily-briefing/

   # install dependencies
   yarn

   # start a local build server with hot reloading
   yarn start
   ```

## ðŸ’« Deployment

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1743f9dd-72ce-4af7-94cf-0fb117d59446/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/daily-briefing/deploys)

The build command `yarn run build` will generate a set of static assets in a `dist` folder which can be deployed to any web hosting service.

My preferred method is to host on [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) which can run this build process in a CI environment and then deploy the build to automatically to a global CDN. Such deployments are [triggered automatically](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) by every git push to the `master` branch of the origin repository.
